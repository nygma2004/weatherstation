# Weather Station
This is the Arduino Sketch for the weather station using non-moving sensors with a ESP8266 (Wemos D1 mini).

The hardware is using the following sensors:

PMS5003 dust sensor
  - PM 1.0
  - PM 2.5
  - PM 10

VEML6070 UV A sensor
  - UVI
  - UV index (calculated)

Si1145 ligth sensor
  - Light intensity
  - Infrared intensity

BME 280 environment sensor
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Atmospheric pressure
